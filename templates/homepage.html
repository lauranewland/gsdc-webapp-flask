         <p>
             The GSDC of Mpls & St. Paul was founded in 1950 to promote the responsible breeding of the German Shepherd Dog;
             to procure the adoption of the "Standard of The German Shepherd Dog" as approved by the American Kennel Club
             by breeders, judges, dog show committees and others as the recognized standard by which this breed shall be
             judged; to protect, advance and improve the interests of the breed by offering prizes, giving and supporting
             breed and obedience shows and in general to aid in every possible means in demonstrating its conspicuous
             abilities as a companion, war, Red Cross, police, herding and lead dog for the blind; and finally to bring
             together, help and encourage all GSD owners in every way without discrimination against any person on the
             basis of age, race, color, sexual preferences or religion.

             German Shepherd Dogs are a very active, intelligent breed. Owning one is a big commitment and part of
             ensuring that you have a happy canine family member is to keep them active both mentally and physically.
             If you have had your German Shepherd Dog for any length of time you have surely experienced “the look”.
             This happens when your dog is staring at you, ears perked, eyes wide as if to say, “So, what are we going
             to do next?” This breed is both athlete AND scholar. It is a dog that desires to be active in body and in
             mind while being with his human partner every step of the way. With one of the best companions in the
             canine world at your side there are many opportunities for you to partner up and have a great time.
