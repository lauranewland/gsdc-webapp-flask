## Membership WebApp for the German Shepherd Dog Club

This webapp was created for the German Shepherd Dog Club of MSP & St. Paul to host their membership directory to reduce 
discrepancies when there is a change in Membership Chair.  Another feature that I implemented is the ability to filter 
and search the membership directory so club members can easily find volunteers for Club hosted events.
